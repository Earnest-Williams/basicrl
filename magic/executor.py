"""Utilities for executing magical work.

This module introduces a simple execution loop for "work" â€“ the game's
term for a magical action. ``execute_work`` validates the work, checks any
active Wards/Counterseals, applies an effect handler mapped from the
``(Art, Substance)`` pair (or an optional callable on the Work itself),
and manages friction accumulation per heartbeat.

The broader magic system has not been implemented yet, so most of the
checks here are placeholders. They log what would normally happen,
allowing other parts of the engine to hook into the process later.

Execution helpers for Works.

The :func:`execute_work` function is a thin wrapper around calling a Work's
effect. Before execution it checks any active :class:`Ward` instances and
optional :class:`Counterseal`s to ensure the Work is permitted.
