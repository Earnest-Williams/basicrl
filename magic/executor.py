"""Utilities for executing magical work.

This module introduces a simple execution loop for "work" â€“ the game's
term for a magical action.  ``execute_work`` validates the work, applies
an effect handler mapped from the ``(Art, Substance)`` pair and manages
friction accumulation per heartbeat.

The broader magic system has not been implemented yet, so most of the
checks here are placeholders.  They log what would normally happen,
allowing other parts of the engine to hook into the process later.
