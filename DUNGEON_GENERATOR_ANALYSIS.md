# Cave System Dungeon Generator Analysis

## Overview

The **Cave System Generator** (located in the `prototypes/Dungeon/` directory) is the primary procedural generation system for creating complex underground environments in basicrl. Unlike the BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) generator used for structured rooms, this system creates organic cave networks that simulate natural geological formations.

## Goals

The Cave System Generator aims to create:

1. **Realistic Cave Networks**: Organic, branching tunnel systems that feel naturally formed
2. **Multi-Level Environments**: Caves with varying depths and vertical complexity
3. **Diverse Geological Features**: Different cavern types, cliff edges, shafts, and chambers
4. **Exploration-Friendly Layouts**: Connected spaces suitable for agent navigation and gameplay
5. **Historical Layering**: Planned future integration of structures from different time periods

## Architecture & Workflow

The generator follows a sophisticated 3-stage pipeline:

### Stage 1: Core Generation (`core.py`)
**Purpose**: Creates the foundational backbone structure

**Algorithm**:
- **Node-Based Growth**: Uses a probability-driven algorithm to grow cave networks as connected nodes
- **Branching Logic**: Employs contextual triggers for branch creation based on:
  - Current depth and distance from start
  - Local density of existing nodes  
  - Angle constraints and momentum bias
  - Probability decay over time
- **Feature Flagging**: Marks nodes for special geological features:
  - `big_room:type` - Large caverns of various shapes
  - `cliff_edge` - Vertical drops and elevation changes
  - `shaft_opening` - Vertical connections between levels
- **Convergence Detection**: Uses `scipy.spatial.KDTree` for efficient detection when branches meet
- **Deterministic Output**: Leverages the central `GameRNG` system for reproducible results

**Key Parameters**:
```python
DEFAULT_INITIAL_PROBABILITY = 100.0
SEGMENT_LENGTH_RANGE = (25.0, 35.0)  # meters
BRANCH_CHECK_INTERVAL = 4
PROBABILITY_DECAY = 10.0
CONVERGENCE_R_MIN/MAX = 5.0/20.0
```

**Output**: Raw node graph (`generated_cave_contextual.json`)

### Stage 2: Processing (`processor.py`) 
**Purpose**: Intermediate processing and geometry calculation

**Functionality**:
- Calculates segment geometry (XY length, incline rates, depth changes)
- Adds geometric metadata to nodes using linear interpolation
- Serves as separation layer for future advanced processing
- Passes through feature flags from core generation

**Planned Expansions**:
- Detailed geological feature calculations
- Flow analysis for water/air movement
- Structural stability assessments

**Output**: Augmented node data (`processed_cave_data.json`)

### Stage 3: Grid Shaping (`shaper.py`)
**Purpose**: Rasterizes the abstract node graph into a playable 2D grid

**Process**:
1. **Rasterization**: Converts node connections into grid cells using `scikit-image`
   - Lines for tunnels
   - Polygons/ellipses for chambers
   - Noise-based shapes for natural caverns
2. **Feature Implementation**: Renders flagged features from core generation
   - Multiple cavern types: `ellipse`, `rectangle`, `multi_circle`, `noisy_ellipse`, `noise_blob`
   - Cliff edges and vertical shafts
3. **Cellular Automata**: Applies smoothing using `scipy.signal.convolve2d` 
4. **3D Information**: Calculates and stores height/depth data
5. **Chamber Labeling**: Uses `scipy.ndimage.label` to identify distinct rooms
6. **Final Output**: High-performance Polars DataFrame saved as Apache Arrow file

**Output**: Final map (`shaped_dungeon_map.arrow`)

## Key Technical Features

### Sophisticated Branching Algorithm
- **Momentum-Based Growth**: Branches maintain directional bias with controlled randomness
- **Contextual Triggering**: Branch probability modified by:
  - Depth (mid-depth peak factor)
  - Local density (sparse areas get higher chance)
  - Angle constraints (straight vs turning)
  - Previous branching history

### Convergence System
- **Smart Branch Merging**: Detects when separate branches should connect
- **KDTree Optimization**: Efficient spatial queries for large cave systems
- **Feature Generation**: Convergence points can trigger special features

### Multi-Level Design
- **Depth Tracking**: Each node has both discrete level and precise depth in meters
- **Vertical Features**: Shafts and cliff edges connect different elevations
- **3D Representation**: While output is 2D, full 3D information is preserved

### Performance Optimizations
- **Numba JIT**: Critical loops accelerated with `@njit` decorators
- **Polars DataFrames**: High-performance data processing
- **Apache Arrow**: Efficient storage and loading of final maps
- **Modular Pipeline**: Each stage can be run independently for testing
